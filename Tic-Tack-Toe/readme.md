# 03. Tic-Tac-Toe
A nine-square grid is used in this two-player game. At each chance, each player chooses their move and marks their square one with O or X. The player who makes all of their marks in a straight line, whether diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, wins. The opposing player's challenge is to both obstruct their opponent's game and construct their own chain.
For building this project in Python who can use the Pygame Python library that is loaded with all computer graphics and sounds.
