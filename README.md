Master your coding skills and boost Up your confidence doing these projects. These projects help you in practice coding and we know practice is the key mantra to grab coding skills.Explore and experiment building projects would give an opportunity to acquaint yourself with the trending tools and technology that are required for your project.
To learn about Software Development Lifecycle, this step is important to be learned when you think you are industry-ready and that you are capable of taking up real-life projects.

# 02.Issue tracking application
Issue-tracking applications give you insight about object oriented programming system. This applications are commonly used by software developers to manage and maintain their issues (i.e. tasks and/or bugs). There are different issue-tracking application with different features. In this project, I aimed to develop a simple issue-tracking application which supports the create, activate, close and cancel an issue by using date time module and re module and user defined function with the help of classes and constructor.

# 03. Tic-Tac-Toe
A nine-square grid is used in this two-player game. At each chance, each player chooses their move and marks their square one with O or X. The player who makes all of their marks in a straight line, whether diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, wins. The opposing player's challenge is to both obstruct their opponent's game and construct their own chain.
